Mantis Shrimp is a computer vision model for photometric redshift estimation in the Northern sky (DEC > -30). This repository houses the model weights, a pip installable package to enable integration with existing projects, a Docker build script to run a local webapp server, jupyter notebooks demonstrating the training of Mantis Shrimp for reproducibility, tutorials in deep learning for astronomy (coming soon), and associated artifacts.  

## WebApp Demonstration
**Access the webapp live at: https://mantisshrimp.pnnl.gov**

</p>
See below for instructions on building webapp using Docker. 

## Windows Limitation

Mantis Shrimp is (implicitly) dependent upon the [healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy) library. Healpy does not currently [support Windows](https://github.com/healpy/healpy/issues/25). Running the installation on a Windows machine will therefore fail.

Windows users can still use Docker to build the WebApp or run our environment within an interactive container.

## Running the Flask WebApp using Docker
To run the webapp, we include a Dockerfile:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
docker build . -t mantisshrimp
docker run -p 5000:5000 mantisshrimp
```
This will launch a flask webapp server accessible from any web browser by navigating to localhost:5000. The webapp has a simple interface that allows you to enter any sky-coordinates one-at-a-time and returns a visualization of the PDF of redshift as well as the cutouts from PanSTARRs, WISE, and GALEX at those coordinates, with an option to donwload the cutout and PDF.

**NOTE: Users should set the gunicorn -w parameter to control the number of workers spawned for running the server.** Most users who are simply testing the server or making quick redshift estimates should choose $N_WORKERS=1. See line 40 of the Dockerfile:
```bash
ENV ENV_NAME=basic
ENV N_WORKERS=1
ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "-c", "source activate $ENV_NAME && gunicorn -w $N_WORKERS -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app"]
```

## Installation Options
This repository serves multiple purposes: our intent is to support users who want to run the mantis shrimp model in inference mode as well as support users who want to re-train the model. We therefore discuss multiple installation options:

#### Users who want to run the model:
To install Mantis Shrimp with dependencies for inference mode only:
```bash
# If you have just installed git-lfs, you may need to run `git lfs install` before `git lfs pull`
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/MantisShrimp.git
cd MantisShrimp
git lfs pull
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
mamba env create --name $ENV_NAME --file production.yml
conda activate $ENV_NAME
pip install .
gunicorn -w $N_WORKERS -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

#### Users who want to train the model:
To install our **exact** training environemnt for reproducibility and training:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/MantisShrimp.git
cd MantisShrimp/run
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
mamba env create --name $ENV_NAME --file environment.yml
conda activate $ENV_NAME
cd ..
git lfs pull
pip install .
```
**One then needs to install the [FFCV](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv) package seperately to run our training scripts.**
**One then also needs to download the dataset via Glubus and [PNNL's DataHub](https://data.pnnl.gov/group/nodes/dataset/33966).**

#### Package Only
To install the Mantis Shrimp package (without dependencies)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/MantisShrimp.git
cd MantisShrimp
git lfs pull
pip install -e .
```

## Tutorial
Mantis Shrimp is a computer vision model, so using it on new data requires querying external servers for image cutouts. **WARNING: querying external services requires an internet connection and can be a point of failure.** 

We include a minimal pipeline command that allows the user to provide coordinates and will return the photometric redshift.

```python

from mantis_shrimp import pipeline
from mantis_shrimp import models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

DEVICE = 'cpu' #pytorch device string; could set to 'cuda'
RA = 197.6144 #decimal degress
DEC = 18.4381 #decimal degrees
USER_INDEX = 0 #arbitrary index used in metadata
SAVEPATH = '/tmp/mantisshrimp/' #create a storage solution for downloaded cutout fits

#attempt to create the path if it doesn't exist already
if not(os.path.exists(SAVEPATH)):
    os.path.makedirs(SAVEPATH)

model, class_bins = models.trained_early(DEVICE)

data = pipeline.get_data(USER_INDEX, RA, DEC, SAVEPATH)

photo_z, PDF, __ = pipeline.evaluate(USER_INDEX,
                                    RA,
                                    DEC,
                                    model=model,
                                    data=data, 
                                    SAVEPATH=SAVEPATH,
                                    device=DEVICE)

# This is the expectation value of the PDF which serves as our point estimate
print(photo_z)

# Or you can use the PDF to extract your own photo_z:
# For now let's visualize the PDF.
plt.title('PDF of PhotoZ for RA={:.3f} DEC={:.3f}'.format(RA,DEC))
plt.plot(class_bins,PDF)
plt.show()
```

## Querying the webapp via API
Once the Webapp is running locally, you can actually ignore installing Mantis Shrimp entirely and simply query an API at the WebApp address. While PNNL runs the Mantis Shrimp server (Before September 2025) you can also query the API at that address.

```python
import requests
 
# URL of the Mantis Shrimp API
url = 'localhost:5000/predict'
 
# Prepare the data payload as a dictionary
data = {"NAME": 0, "RA":197.6144, "DEC": 18.4381}  # Example: sending data to our API
 
# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
 
# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Success!")
    print("Response data:", response.json())  # Print the response data from the server
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data")
    print("Status code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response text:", response.text)  # Display response text which might contain the error
```

## Limitations

This repository should be used with special context that the computer vision model was trained over a tailored dataset of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with cutouts centered on those galaxies. Our pipeline will assign a photometric redshift to arbitrary coordinates of the sky. **However, that does not mean our model should be trusted everywhere--** galaxies that are not observed in the PanSTARRS/WISE footprint are simply not going to have accurate photometric redshifts with this tool. Additional care must be taken to ensure the target galaxy is centered on the image, which is why we advise using our tool in tandem with sky browsers, for example, available from [PanSTARRs](https://ps1images.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/ps1cutouts).

Additionally, its not likely our model extends well to galaxies outside the support of our spectroscopic training datasets, which are biased to large red elliptical galaxies. This is a problem shared for essentially all machine learning photometric redshift models unless we limit ourselves to flux-limited samples like the SDSS MGS, or soon the DESI BGS. Future work should endeavor to either mitigate this by utilizing simulated images to augment the training set or use anomaly detection to flag when cutouts are unlike anything in the training distribution. Both would be at the cutting edge of AI research. 

## Data availability

You can download the Mantis Shrimp Dataset from [PNNL's Datahub](https://data.pnnl.gov/group/nodes/dataset/33966). DataHub is a free to use data repository for PNNL; its backend is Globus. 

## External Dependencies & Considerations
In addition to the software dependencies, this software relies upon the availability of data from NASA STSci and NSF AstroDataLab servers. 

We have packaged this webapp with dustmaps provided by Yi-Kuan Chiang, author of the corrected SFD map, and the Planck map provided by the European Space Agency. The exact sources of this data are:
```bash
#STSci and ADL:
